# package-relation-js

Complex arithmetic package for the [Fōrmulæ](https://formulae.org) programming language.

Fōrmulæ is also a software framework for visualization, edition and manipulation of complex expressions, from many fields. The code for an specific field —i.e. arithmetics— is encapsulated in a single unit called a Fōrmulæ **package**.

This repository contains the source code for the **relation arithmetic package**. It is intended to the visualization of relation expressions.

The GitHub organization [formulae-org](https://github.com/formulae-org) encompasses the source code for the rest of packages, as well as the [web application](https://github.com/formulae-org/formulae-js).

<!--
Take a look at this [tutorial](https://formulae.org/?script=tutorials/Complex) to know the capabilities of the Fōrmulæ arithmetic package.

### Capabilities ###

* Visualization of [relational operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_operator) as $a = b$, $a \ne b$, $a > b$, $a < b$, $a \leq b$, $a \geq b$
* Visualization of [three-way comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-way_comparison) through the **COMPARE TO** expression
* Visualization and reduction of the [maximum and minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_and_minimum) expressions, visualized as $`\max \{ ... \}`$ and $`\min\{ ... \}`$
* Visualization and reduction of the [membership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics)), visualized as $`x \in \{ ... \}`$ and $`x \notin \{ ... \}`$
